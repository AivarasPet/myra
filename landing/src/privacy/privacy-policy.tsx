                <strong>MB Sverto</strong>, registered at{" "}
                <strong>Naugarduko g. 68-3, Vilnius, Lithuania</strong>,
                operates Sverto’s hosted service and is the controller of the
                personal information we process to provide that service. Contact
                us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sverto.com">privacy@sverto.com</a>{" "}
                with questions or requests concerning your information.
              </p>
              <p>
                This policy covers the Sverto website, hosted application and
                mobile apps when used with our hosted service. Sverto helps you
                record and understand your financial activity, investments and
                net worth.
              </p>
              <h3>Adults only</h3>
              <p>
                Sverto is intended for people aged <strong>18 and over</strong>{" "}
                and is not directed at children. If you believe someone under 18
                has provided personal information to our hosted service, contact
                us using the address above so we can investigate and arrange
                appropriate deletion.
              </p>
              <h3>Self-hosted installations</h3>
              <p>
                If you connect to a self-hosted server, the operator of that
                server controls the financial records and other information sent
                to it. Records sent only to that server are not received by MB
                Sverto. The server operator’s configuration and policies
                determine its hosting, authentication, AI processing and
                retention.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some mobile SDKs can still communicate with their providers
                independently of the selected server. In particular, if you
                enable Android’s optional ML Kit category suggestions, the SDK
                can send technical and usage telemetry to Google. Contacting our
                support or visiting our website also involves processing
                separate from your self-hosted server.

              <p>
                Myra sends your request and the relevant context needed to
                answer it to the Gemini API. Context can include conversation
                history, attachments and financial records retrieved by Myra’s
                tools. Your conversations and proposed actions are stored so you
                can return to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Semantic search also uses the Gemini API to turn text, such as
                transaction descriptions and search queries, into numerical
                representations. This can happen when descriptions are saved or
                updated, separately from opening a Myra conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hosted service uses the Gemini API under paid-service data
                terms. Google states that paid-service prompts and responses are
                not used to improve its products. Separate safety processing
                still applies: its published abuse-monitoring policy describes
                retaining prompts, context and outputs for 55 days, with
                restricted human review for suspected misuse. See{" "}

                Android category suggestions are off by default and can be
                enabled in Settings → Category suggestions. The choice is stored
                on this installation and is excluded from backup restoration.
                You can continue choosing categories manually without enabling
                it. Suggestions run on the device using ML Kit. This local
                feature does not itself send its input or generated output to
                Google servers, but the SDK sends technical and usage metrics
                for performance, debugging, maintenance, API improvement and
                abuse prevention. This is governed by{" "}
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms">

                , separately from paid Gemini processing. Saving a financial
                record to your hosted account is a separate server operation.
                Turning suggestions off stops new feature requests and cancels
                pending suggestion work. It does not delete telemetry Google
                already received or guarantee cancellation of metrics already
                queued by the SDK.

                International transfer arrangements depend on the provider,
                service and destination. Axiom’s published data-processing terms
                include EU standard contractual clauses. Clerk’s and Google’s
                published terms describe the EU–US Data Privacy Framework where
                applicable and standard contractual clauses for relevant
                transfers. These mechanisms address international transfers;
                they do not mean processing stays within the EU. You can request

              <h2>7. Retention and deletion</h2>
              <p>
                Different types of information have different lifetimes.
                Deleting a record from the active service does not necessarily
                erase operational logs, backups or provider safety records at
                the same moment.
              </p>

                  <dt>Hosted account and financial records</dt>
                  <dd>
                    We retain your account and financial records while your
                    account is active. Account deletion removes your profile and
                    associated financial and conversation records from the
                    active application database. The separate retention periods
                    below apply to operational records and provider copies.

                  <dd>
                    Conversations can be deleted. Deleting a conversation does
                    not itself delete its separately stored files. Account
                    deletion removes the associated database records and
                    requests removal of stored uploads, thumbnails and exports.
                    Storage failures can prevent file removal.

                    Account deletion requests removal of your authentication

                    Background processing records can include transaction
                    descriptions or correction text. They do not have an
                    automatic expiry and are not automatically removed when a
                    task finishes or an account is deleted. They remain until
                    separately deleted. You can ask us to include these records
                    in a deletion request using the contact details below.

                    Our hosting plan provides access to the most recent 7 days

                    Backup copies can remain after information is deleted from
                    the active service. Their retention depends on the
                    applicable backup settings and the provider’s recovery
                    arrangements. Active account deletion does not immediately
                    erase these copies, and we do not promise a fixed erasure
                    deadline for them.

                The hosted service uses HTTPS for public app/API connections and
                authenticated access to user records. Provider credentials are
                handled through server-side secret storage. File access uses
                authenticated operations or time-limited links.

              <p>
                The apps can keep local preferences, session information and
                cached records to support their operation, including offline
                access where available. Information retained only on your device
                is distinct from information sent to our service. A self-hosted
                server’s transport security and access controls depend on its
                configuration.
